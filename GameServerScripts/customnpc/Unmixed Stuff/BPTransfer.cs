/*
 * Created by VaNaTiC@gmx.net 
 * for Thidranki Classic (http://www.thidrankiclassic.de)
 * 
 * Some notes:
 * - first I have to say sorry for my rusty english :D
 * - I removed the AddToWorld() so it's customizable by yourself with /mob ...
 * - its configurable with properties, dont edit code except who know what u do
 * - feel free to derive your own TransferNPC instead of rewrite some code,
 *   so its more comfortable for yourself if I had to release some new things
 * - let this section in the files if u install it on your server
 * - and let me know if u (dis)like something
 * 
 * Features:
 * - it interacts with the player, with examine-message
 * - gives info under what rules the transfer is done (automatical handled by the properties) * 
 * - it does a full RP/BP/money transfer
 * - as a security-feature who have to start this with the char from which u wanna transfer
 * - u can choose a possible char from a list
 * - possible to do it with /whisper CHARNAME
 * - no special handling for RP/BP-factor is needed, cause of full transfer and setting to zero
 * - if realm-transfer a realmrespec is done
 * - I integrated two logs, 1st is GM-Log, 2nd is Game-Log, its only written to one of them
 * - you could enable/disable realmlevel-based bountypoint costs for usage of transfer
 * - additional you can give a realmlevel-based costfree transfer each x-days
 * 
 * ChangeLog:
 * 2007-03-27:
 * - fixed a bug on handling LastFreeTransfer (LastFreeLeveled)
 * 2007-03-26:
 * - added costs for usages (enable/disable by property)
 * 2007-03-21:
 * - added char list
 * - added money transfer
 * 2007-01-14:
 * - added logging
 * - added code-doc
 * - fixed removing from old char RealmPoints if ts odd-numbered
 * 2006-12:
 * - removed constructor
 * - created
 *
