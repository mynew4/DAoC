 * Added a check for Realm Rank, which boots the player if they are over
 * RR7 when the mob dies.  Added a check for how many players are online,
 * if you want to boot the player out of the farm zone if there are a
 * certain number of players online.  Also added a base ammount based on
 * the mobs level, plus there is a 5% chance for a jackpot which will
 * reward either 2x or 3x the ammount to the player.  Also added screen
 * center messages.  Also added a division of the reward based on the
 * number of players in the group.  Also added a check for if the player
 * is actually in the farm zone before it gives the reward (you must change
 * the farm zone region number to match yours, currently it's set to Darkness Falls.
